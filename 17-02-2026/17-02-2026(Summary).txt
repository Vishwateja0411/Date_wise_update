📘finding missing element in the array

🔹Approach (Sum Formula Method)

1.find n as:
n=len(arr)+1
2.Calculate the expected sum using the formula.
expected = n * (n + 1) // 2
3.Calculate the actual sum of elements in the array.
actual = sum(arr)
4.The difference between expected sum and actual sum gives the missing number.
expected - actual

📘Find Frequency of Each Element

🔹Approach (HashMap / Dictionary Method)

Use a dictionary to store element counts.
Traverse the array one by one.
For each element:
 If it already exists in the dictionary → increase its count.
 Otherwise → initialize count as 1.
Return the dictionary containing frequencies

🔹Steps

Create an empty dictionary freq.
Loop through each element in the array.
Update count using:
freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
Return the frequency dictionary.

📘Move Zeros to End

🔹Approach (Two Pointer Method)

Use two pointers:
i → traverses the array
j → points to the position where the next non-zero element should be placed
Traverse the array:
If the current element is non-zero:
Swap it with the element at index j
Increment j
After traversal, all non-zero elements will be at the beginning and zeros automatically move to the end.
🔹 Steps

Initialize pointer j = 0

Loop through the array using index i

If arr[i] != 0:

Swap arr[i] and arr[j]

Increment j
Return the modified array

📘 Sort Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s 🔹 Approach (Three Pointer Method)

Use three pointers:

low → position where next 0 should go

mid → current element being checked

high → position where next 2 should go
Rules:

If element is 0:

Swap with low

Move both low and mid forward
If element is 1:

Move mid forward
If element is 2:

Swap with high
Move high backward (do not move mid immediately)

🔹 Steps

Initialize:

low = 0
mid = 0
high = len(arr) - 1
Traverse while mid <= high

Apply rules based on value at arr[mid]

Return sorted array
