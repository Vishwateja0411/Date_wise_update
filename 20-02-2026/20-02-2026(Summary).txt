📘 Two Sum (Two Pointer Approach)

🔹 Approach (Two Pointer Method)

First sort the array.
Use two pointers:
i → start of array
j → end of array
Calculate current sum:
If sum equals target → pair found
If sum is smaller → move left pointer forward
If sum is larger → move right pointer backward
Continue until pointers meet.

🔹 Steps

Sort the array
Initialize:
i = 0
j = len(arr) - 1
While i < j:
Compute sum
Move pointers based on comparison
Return result


📘 Find Single Element in Array

🔹 Approach (Brute Force Method)

Traverse each element in the array.

Count how many times it appears.

If count equals 1 → return that element.

If no element found → return -1.

🔹 Steps

Loop through array using index i

For each element:

Initialize count = 0

Traverse entire array again

Count occurrences

If count == 1 → return element

📘 Maximum Consecutive Ones

🔹 Approach (Linear Traversal)

Traverse the array once.

Maintain:

cnt → current consecutive count of 1’s

maxi → maximum count found so far

If element is 1 → increment count.

If element is 0 → reset count to 0.

Update maximum after each step.

🔹 Steps

Initialize:

cnt = 0
maxi = 0

Loop through array:

If value is 1 → cnt += 1

Else → cnt = 0

Update maxi = max(maxi, cnt)

Return maxi
